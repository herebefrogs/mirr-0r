game
  - hit points for alien ships
  - different firing/motion strategies for alien ships
  - more alien ships
  - better alien shadows sprite
  - static level via LDtk.io
  - level boss
    - protected by rotating and reflective mirrors
    - hidden behind one of the mirror, must hit the right mirror
     (or else what?) until no more hiding place (L's idea)
  - better entering of mirror dimension (diamond shape initiating from lead ship)
  - actually different mirror dimension
    - visually
    - different enemy waves
  - music track
  - sound effect
  - less creepy speech synthesis
  - actual squadron AI autonomy
  - keyboard control localization
- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

tech debt
=========
  - rethink viewportOffset... should only be for drawing stuff, not for any math
    -> so maybe the viewport is scrolling up instead of the whole world moving down
    (or is it actually this way and would make more sense the other way around?)
    ((math is hard and make my head hurt))
    (((big)))
  - swap referential origin to bottom left (big)


bugs
====
- font is all garbled on some player screens
  (can't make it happen maybe a windows thing?)
  ((scale canvas in multiples of font size??))
- fix tap control on end screen restarting the game as soon as finger lifted
- lead ship "strafe" if promoted while in the edge-snapping area
