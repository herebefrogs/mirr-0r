bugs
====
- font is all garbled on some player screens
  (can't make it happen maybe a windows thing?)
  ((scale canvas in multiples of font size??))
- sometime speech synthesis is late or don't play at all (cache all possible utterance ahead of time)
- fix tap control on end screen restarting the game as soon as finger lifted
- lead ship "strafe" if promoted while in the edge-snapping area

game
====
  - different firing/motion strategies for alien ships
  - experiment with speech synthesis
  - more alien ships
  - better alien shadows sprite
  - static level via LDtk.io
  - level boss
    - protected by rotating and reflective mirrors
    - hidden behind one of the mirror, must hit the right mirror
     (or else what?) until no more hiding place (L's idea)
  - better entering of mirror dimension (diamond shape initiating from lead ship) -> disable until then
  - actually different mirror dimension
    - visually
    - different enemy waves
  - music track
  - sound effect
  - less creepy speech synthesis
  - actual squadron AI autonomy
  - keyboard control localization
- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

tech debt
=========
  - rename wingfolks to wingman and flight to squadron
  - rethink viewportOffset... should only be for drawing stuff, not for any math
    -> so maybe the viewport is scrolling up instead of the whole world moving down
    (or is it actually this way and would make more sense the other way around?)
    ((math is hard and make my head hurt))
    (((big)))
    touches:
      - updateScrolling()
  - swap referential origin to bottom left (big)
      - moving up should be +1, not -1
